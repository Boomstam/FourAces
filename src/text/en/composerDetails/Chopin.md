Although Chopin was very good-natured and tranquillity personified, this work exploded across the concert hall with incomparable energy, but also with an undertone of sweet love.

It was Chopin’s rendition of this work that attracted the attention of his female artistic opposite, namely author Georges Sand (whose real name was Amandine Dudevant). The woman who always wore long trousers and smoked a pipe fell head over heels in love for the musician, ultimately resulting not only in a broken heart but also in a successful book, ‘Winter in Mallorca’.

There were not enough superlatives to describe this scherzo at the time:
Fellow composer Robert Schumann thought the piece ‘overflowed with tenderness, love, daringness and disdain’, while music critic James Huneker went even further, calling it ‘a masterful piece’ and ‘written in the heart of the piano and thus a work of which a hundred generations could not improve the pages’.

Excuse me. What did you say?
