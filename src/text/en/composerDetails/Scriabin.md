Just like Sergei Rachmaninoff, Scriabin was a student at the conservatory in Moscow in the piano class of Vasil Safonov and the composition class of Anton Arensky. He was generally considered to be the best student, and yet throughout his life, he continued to be compared to the virtuosity of his competitor and colleague, and though as a concert pianist and composer he enjoyed lifelong employment and financial security, the constant comparisons to Rachmaninoff caused frustrations that became a haunting leitmotif in his personal life. Even an amorous adventure with a Belgian lady was not enough to surmount this persistent feeling.

Perhaps he should simply have chosen a different instrument. Well, you might think that he lost his chance, but we know how to solve the problem.
