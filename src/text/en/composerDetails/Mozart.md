Mozart wrote this work as a 25-year-old young ‘wag’, undoubtedly with wild and wavy (wig) hair. He was the rock hero of his age, after all, and what self-respecting, long-haired poster boy doesn’t play guitar these days? It’s a shame the instrument did not yet exist in his time.

In 1997, the Colombian Foundation Center for Epilepsy and Neurological Diseases (FIRE) suggested that Mozart’s sonata KV448 might have the so-called "Mozart effect". This means that listening to this music may have a favourable effect on spatial awareness and that among epilepsy sufferers, it may lead to fewer attacks. And who are we to contradict science?

On the contrary, let us lend a hand and double to effect! ‘Spirito’ was written for four guitars, wasn’t it?
