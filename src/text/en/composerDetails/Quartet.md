Classical guitar won&#39;t get more fancy than with the Four Aces
Guitar Quartet. Eight years after their debut these four well
dressed hot shots have outgrown their flemish roots. Especially
their second cd Odyssee was a big succes, even in China. Whilst
Bart, Inti, Menno and Stein are now leaving the Odyssee behind,
they are eagerly exploring new, unknown territories. On their
newest album For Aces you&#39;ll only find compositions written
especially for them.
The quartet was born in the summer of 2008 during the
International Guitar Symposium in Iserlohn, where they first met.
Their first gig was part of a final project at the conservatory of
Antwerp. The audience and he jury were immediately impressed
with the virtuosity and musical colours the four managed to
present.
Afterwards the Four Aces Guitar Quartet played concerts in major
halls in Belgium. Abroad they performed in the Netherlands,
Germany, France, Slovenia, Italy, Georgia and China. The quartet
also appeared in live broadcasting shows on the Dutch station
Radio 4, on the Belgian tv-channel Canvas and on Belgian classical
radio Klara.

In 2013 the Four Aces Guitar Quartet returned to Iserlohn, but
now to give masterclasses during the Guitar Symposium. That
same year they won Supernova, a Belgian chamber music
competition that is supported by the national radio and tv-
channel, as well as the Flemish government and numerous
cultural partners.
As a quartet Bart, Inti, Menno and Stein continued looking for
perfection by taking masterclasses with some of the most famous
guitarists of the planet. To name a few: Aniello Desiderio, the
Katona Twins, David Russel and Johan Fostier. One of their
highlights so far remains the common concert with Grammy
award winner Andrew York, who also is one of the founding
members of the Los Angeles Guitar Quartet.
In 2013 the ensemble won Supernova, a Belgian chamber music
competition organised by national television and radio, the
Belgian government and many cultural partners across the
country. In 2017 the quartet won the international chamber
music competition ‘Paola Ruminelli’ in Ossola (Italy)
