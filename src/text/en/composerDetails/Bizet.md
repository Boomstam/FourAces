On the morning of 4 March 1875, Georges Bizet must have buried his head in his hands or choked on his coffee and croissant when he read the reviewers of his newest opera ‘Carmen’ in the leading newspapers.

‘Le Moniteur’ described it as academic noise, ‘La Patrie’ even called it a downright flop, and other papers were similarly ‘complimentary’.

Perhaps audience were not yet ready for such a daring story with a protagonist who flouted all the moral norms of the time, or perhaps Mister Bizet had overlooked something in his music by attempting to evoke the atmosphere of Spain without implementing a single note from the instrument that exudes Spain more than any other, and which was in the midst of taking its rightful place on the musical stage at the time, namely (…and you’ve guessed it), the classical guitar.
It is time to put things to rights.
