Both preludes that were originally written for piano are part of a 10-part series that Sergei Rachmaninoff wrote for his cousin Alexander Siloti.

These works brought together a range of emotions: on the one hand, sadness and melancholy because in the period that these works were written, Rachmaninoff was financially destitute. On the other hand, gratitude to Siloti who offered him a place to live in these difficult times, but also for supporting him by being a witness to his marriage to their cousin Natalia, which raised many eyebrows at the time.

Love and passion are thus an integral part of the emotional rollercoaster that characterizes both preludes and what instrument could express all these emotions better than… the guitar?
