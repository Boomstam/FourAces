Claude Debussy wrote this three-part milestone after being inspired by various instruments while walking through the World Exhibition in Paris in 1889, leading him to reinvent the tonal colour of the piano.

It was an exciting challenge, but something of a waste of time according to us because the ideal instrument to express the pentatonic scale of ‘Pagodes’ and the Spanish atmosphere in ‘Soirée dans Grenade’ was already available. Manuel de Falla once alluded to this mistake by proposing ‘option guitar’ in his ‘Hommage pour le tombeau Claude Debussy’.

It’s not a problem.
