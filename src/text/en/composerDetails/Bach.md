When you browse the extensive oeuvre of this composer attentively, you are regularly struck by a feeling of ‘déjà entendu’. 
There was absolutely no shame at the time in reusing one’s own phrases or even borrowing from fellow composers. It was common practice, and it was even considered an honour when fragments of your music were used or reused.

Listen to Cantate 29 and the Prelude from Partita n°3, for example, and you will hear the organ playing what the violin plays in the other piece. Or listen to Cantata 156 and the Arioso of Piano Concerto n°5 or the opening movement of Brandenburg Concerto n°1 and the ‘Sinfonia from Cantata 52, and there are many other examples.

Maybe Bach was simply searching for a better arrangement of earlier work. A version 2.0, as it were - and maybe he was thinking about a 3.0 but simply couldn't find the right instrumentation?

You’re welcome Johann!
